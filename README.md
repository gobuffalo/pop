# POP

## A Tasty Treat For All Your Database Needs

So what does Pop do exactly? Well, it wraps the absolutely amazing [https://github.com/jmoiron/sqlx](https://github.com/jmoiron/sqlx) library. It cleans up some of the common patterns and work flows usually associated with dealing with databases in Go.

Pop makes it easy to do CRUD operations, run migrations, and build/execute queries.

Pop, by default, follows conventions that were influenced by the [ActiveRecord](http://www.rubyonrails.org) Ruby gem. What does this mean?

* Tables must have an "id" column and a corresponding "ID" field on the `struct` being used.
* If there is a `timestamp` column named `created_at`, and a `CreatedAt time.Time` attribute on the `struct`, it will be set with the current time when the record is created.
* If there is a `timestamp` column named `updated_at`, and a `UpdatedAt time.Time` attribute on the `struct`, it will be set with the current time when the record is updated.
* Default database table names are lowercase, plural, and underscored versions of the `struct` name. Examples: User{} is "users", FooBar{} is "foo_bars", etc...
